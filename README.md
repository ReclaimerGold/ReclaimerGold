# HULLO! I'm Ryan.
I'm the Founder of, and Lead Web Designer for [@FallsTechGroup](https://github.com/FallsTechGroup).

I design solutions and toolkits to help individuals and businesses gain easier access to automations and quality-of-life improvements that can help them create, make, and build better, faster, and smarter. Much of my public repositories serve as an opportunity for me to give back some of the work that I've done to help solve problems at a lower cost.

## Current Projects

**[Declarative Homelab](https://github.com/ReclaimerGold/rnd-terraform)** - This repository is utilized to manage the infrastructure configuration of the Reif.NET datacenter network. This project uses Terraform, FluxCD, Talos OS, and Kubernetes, with plans for more.
